## Introduction



## Idea
export const f1 = 'Y = f(w^{T}\\vec{x} + \\vec{b})';
export const f2 = '\\begin{bmatrix}a & b \\\\ c & d\\end{bmatrix}';

Starting with the simplest possible function: 

Let <Latex formula='w,x \in \R^n'/>, <Latex formula='b \in \R'/>, <Latex formula='f:R \to R \in C^{-1}(\R)'/>. Technically, this is over
numbers representable by floating point and not R, but this representation is close enough

<Latex formula={f1}/>

We can represent this function as an instruction <Latex formula='dot\space a \space b \space c'/>, which takes two registers a and b
and performs a dot product on them and stores the result into c.

```cpp
int dot(int* v1, int* v2, int num) {
    int total = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < num; i++) {
        total += v1[i] * v2[i];
    }
}
```

```asm
dot(int*, int*, int):
        sub     sp, sp, #48
        str     x0, [sp, 24]
        str     x1, [sp, 16]
        str     w2, [sp, 12]
        str     wzr, [sp, 44]
        str     wzr, [sp, 40]
        b       .L2
.L3:
        ldrsw   x0, [sp, 40]
        lsl     x0, x0, 2
        ldr     x1, [sp, 24]
        add     x0, x1, x0
        ldr     w1, [x0]
        ldrsw   x0, [sp, 40]
        lsl     x0, x0, 2
        ldr     x2, [sp, 16]
        add     x0, x2, x0
        ldr     w0, [x0]
        mul     w0, w1, w0
        ldr     w1, [sp, 44]
        add     w0, w1, w0
        str     w0, [sp, 44]
        ldr     w0, [sp, 40]
        add     w0, w0, 1
        str     w0, [sp, 40]
.L2:
        ldr     w1, [sp, 40]
        ldr     w0, [sp, 12]
        cmp     w1, w0
        blt     .L3
        brk #1000
```

In theory, this would be carried out by a single instruction <Latex formula='dot\space a \space b \space c'/>. However, in practice, it seems

difficult to imagine that being an atomic instruction that the CPU could carry out.

difficult to imagine that being an atomic instruction that the CPU could carry out. Especially, since a dot-product is composed of several atomic 'cpu'
operations i.e add and mul. So it begs the question of what value does representing the operation as 'dot' bring?

If you look at the instruction, <Latex formula={f1}/>, this can be expanded to  <Latex formula='Y = w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + ... + w_nx_n + b'/>, with each <Latex formula='w_nx_n'/> being seperately calculable and also being the same format. 

So we can do two optimizations at the computing level:
1. Parallelize them
2. Use the same instruction for each the paralleled operations
